# Rate My Society

**Rate My Society** is an online platform where students can view, rate, and review university societies—giving prospective members real, honest insight before joining.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
> This project is still under development and not yet ready for public deployment. The focus is currently on finalizing the core review system. Once stable, the platform will launch with a limited selection of societies and universities, expanding gradually over time.

### Vision

The UK has nearly **150 universities**, each averaging around **200 societies** - totaling over **30,000 societies** nationwide. That's a significant amount of data, and full coverage will take time. However, the goal is to eventually support **every university in the UK**.
